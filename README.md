# Lab Assignment 1: Student Grades Analysis

## Problem Statement

Write a program that reads the grades of `N` students in a class on an assignment and stores them in an array `scores` of size `N`. The program should then perform the following tasks:

- **Find and display:**
  - The maximum grade in the class.
  - The minimum grade in the class.
  - The average grade of the class.

- **Create an array `stats` of size 5**, which will represent:
  - `stats[4]`: The number of grades above 80.
  - `stats[3]`: The number of grades from 61 to 80.
  - `stats[2]`: The number of grades from 41 to 60.
  - `stats[1]`: The number of grades from 21 to 40.
  - `stats[0]`: The number of grades from 0 to 20.

- **Create a bar graph** representing the `scores` array. Each bar will be represented by the symbol `#######`, and the grade ranges will be displayed below the graph.
